# Combination Sum

### Description
Given a set of `candidate` numbers (without duplicates) and a `target` number, find all unique combinations in `candidate` where the `candidate` numbers sums to `target`.

The same repeated number may be chosen from `candidate` unlimited number of times.

### Example:
```
For example, given candidate set [2, 3, 6, 7] and target 7, a solution set is: 
[
  [7],
  [2, 2, 3]
]
```

**Note:**
* All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
* The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
