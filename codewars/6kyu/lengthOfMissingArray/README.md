#Length of Missing Array

###Description:
You get an array of arrays. If you sort the arrays by their length, you will see, that their length-values are consecutive. But one array is missing!

You have to write a method, that return the length of the missing array.

If the array of arrays is null, return 0. When an array in the array is null or empty, return 0 too!

There will always be a missing element and its length will be always between the given arrays. 

###Example:
`[[1, 2], [4, 5, 1, 1], [1], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]] --> 3`
