###Challenge Description:

You have a string of words and digits divided by comma. Write a program which separates words with digits. You shouldn't change the order elements.

###Input Sample:

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Input example is the following
```
8,33,21,0,16,50,37,0,melon,7,apricot,peach,pineapple,17,21
24,13,14,43,41
```

###Output Sample:
```
melon,apricot,peach,pineapple|8,33,21,0,16,50,37,0,7,17,21
24,13,14,43,41
```

As you can see you need to output the same input string if it has words only or digits only.
